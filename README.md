# Streak Log

The idea behind streak log is that I always found success to be far more motivating to start the next thing or keep going that dwelling on my failures. So I built this simple app to help motivate myself in building and maintaining good habits. The idea is to keep a log of my daily accomplishments and how long I am able to maintain a streak of succussfully completiing my daily routines.
